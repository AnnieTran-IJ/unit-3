## Q1. What was the most proud moment for you during this project?
The most satisfactory moment is when all the screens got connected together and the data is actually saved in the database.
I also got very amused when researching about the hashing algorithm and try to apply it as a protection layer for the admin side.

## Q2. What worked well this time?
I tried combining the concept of a secret management program that we did in Project 1 and in turns out better than I expected. Combining it that way, I realize how I could apply different aspects of technology together, which is very cool

## Q3. What will you do different for unit 4/IA?
I will update the record of task and plan out the wireframe earlier. Also, I will plan out what I want to write for Criteria C a bit sooner too, and dig deep into 3 complex function instead of too many functions.

## Q4. What do you need help with?
Diagram! I understand the logic but I can't seem to understand how to put it back in flowchart.
